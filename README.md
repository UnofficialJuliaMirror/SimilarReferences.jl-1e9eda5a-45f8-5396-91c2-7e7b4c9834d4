# SimilarReferences.jl
It is a library for approximate nearest neighbor search, implementing several indexes for SimilaritySearch.jl

- `Kvp`: _K vantage points_ is an exact and approximate index useful to speed up high dimensional datasets
- `Knr`: _K nearest refences_ is an approxiamte index useful to speed up nearest neighbor search in large datasets
